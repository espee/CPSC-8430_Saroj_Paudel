This repository holds code for the assignment is included in the three Jupyter Notebook  files.
The three files are for three different tasks. 

1-1 Deep vs Shallow : https://github.com/espee/CPSC-8430_Saroj_Paudel/blob/main/HW1-1.ipynb

1-2 Optimization : https://github.com/espee/CPSC-8430_Saroj_Paudel/blob/main/HW1-2.ipynb

1-3 Generalization : https://github.com/espee/CPSC-8430_Saroj_Paudel/blob/main/HW1-3.ipynb

A pdf showing important result is also included. 

Dependencies:

Python 3.x Jupyter Notebook PyTorch
Also used CUDA framework

Dataset: MNIST
